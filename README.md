# C++Project
 Recoloring image project
 
 About ::
This project require magic to work
literally a Magic++ library
Magic is used to load/ write file
Finding closest pixel is used by query in kD tree 
Kd tree used is simple 3d binary tree with 0,0,0 as root,
all pixels in image are represented by their RGB values 
Sorting unique pixels is done by simpli adding them to std::set


Things to do ::
whole "user comunication" layer is not done,images file paths are HARDCODED in source
alghorith could youse multiple threads to speed up whole process but my attempts failed
