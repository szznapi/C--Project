# C++Project
 Recoloring image project
 
 About :
This project require magic to work.
Literally a Magic++ library.
Magic++ is used to load/ write image files and get pixels RGB values.
Finding closest pixel is used by query in kD tree. 
Kd tree is simple 3d binary tree with 0,0,0 as root,
with all uniques pixels as tree nodes.
Sorting unique pixels is done by simply adding them to std::set


Things to do ::
whole "user comunication" layer is not done,images file paths are HARDCODED in source
alghorith could youse multiple threads to speed up whole process but my attempts failed
